# Github User Search

## Background

I am creating this ReactJS application to practise my ReactJS knowledge. This application consumes the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

## Requirements

- [x] There is a search bar to let the user search by username (login name)
- [ ] While searching, the application shows an animated loading indicator made by CSS (using gif image is not allowed)
- [x] After the search is completed, the application shows the list of users along with their avatar and their username on the same page
- [ ] If the results are not complete in one page, the pagination is shown on the screen
- [ ] When a list item is clicked, the application is navigated to a new page that display the parsed JSON payload of that user
- [ ] The new page also has to display the list of the user's repositories, followers and following
- [ ] The application is built by [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- [ ] [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) is being used to build the application
- [ ] The application style is built by one of the CSS preprocessors or CSS-in-JS
- [ ] The application has to be responsive and optimised for mobile
- [ ] A documentation on how the application works and how to set up and build the project is provided
- [ ] The application is production ready (**HINT:** try Googleâ€™s PageSpeed or Lighthouse)

## Bonus points

- [ ] The application is deployed on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) instead of [Heroku](http://heroku.com) or [Now](https://zeit.co/now) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [ ] The application supports IE10 and/or Android native browser (Chrome 30.0)
- [ ] The pages are server-side rendered and are cached in the server
- [ ] All pages' URL is reusable - meaning it can be copied and pasted on different browser and still shows the same result
- [ ] All pages are SEO optimised
- [ ] The project supports code splitting for each pages
- [ ] The results list also asynchronous-ly shows the number of followers and following of each user without going the user page
- [ ] The search input does the searching as you type (See google search as an example)
- [ ] There is animated transition between pages
- [ ] The application supports theming and can easily be switched between themes
- [ ] Unit tests
